# Scrapping-Census-Data

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Scrapping-Census-Data.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to extract data from the U.S. Census Bureau's website.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of web scraping techniques applied to publicly available data from the Census Bureau. This can be useful for researchers, data analysts, and developers who need to access specific data that may not be available through official APIs or downloadable formats.

## Notebook Description

* `census_data_extraction.ipynb`: This notebook includes Python code that:
    * Uses libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to download and parse HTML content from Census Bureau web pages.
    * Demonstrates how to identify and extract relevant data elements.
    * Provides examples of how to organize and store the extracted data (e.g., into Pandas DataFrames).
    * It may also include examples of how to handle pagination, and dynamic content.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

* `requests`
* `BeautifulSoup4` (bs4)
* `pandas`
* `jupyter` (if you want to run the notebook locally)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas jupyter
